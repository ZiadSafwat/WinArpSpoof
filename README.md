## 🏗️ Build Instructions

Although `WinArpSpoof.exe` is built for **Windows**, it is compiled on **Linux** using the MinGW cross-compiler.

### 🔧 Requirements for building (Linux) 

- `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`
- WinPcap Developer Pack [(`WpdPack`)](https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm)

### 🧪 Build Command
- you need [WinPcap Developer's Pack](https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm)
- for 64-bit Windows
```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc WinArpSpoof.c -o WinArpSpoof.exe \
-I/your_path_to_winpcap_dev_pack/Include \
-I/your_path_to_winpcap_dev_pack/Include/pcap \
-L/your_path_to_winpcap_dev_pack/Lib/x64 \
-lwpcap -liphlpapi -lws2_32
```
- for 32-bit Windows
```bash
i686-w64-mingw32-gcc WinArpSpoof.c -o WinArpSpoof_32bit.exe \
-I/your_path_to_winpcap_dev_pack/Include \
-I/your_path_to_winpcap_dev_pack/Include/pcap \
-L/your_path_to_winpcap_dev_pack/Lib \
-lwpcap -liphlpapi -lws2_32
